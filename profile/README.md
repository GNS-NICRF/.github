The NICRF is led by [Dr Nancy Bertler](https://www.gns.cri.nz/about-us/our-people/meet-our-principal-scientists/dr-nancy-bertler/).

The NICRF is jointly funded by [Earth Sciences New Zealand](https://www.earthsciences.nz/) (formerly GNS Science) and [Victoria University of Wellington](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/).

We are engaged in a range of ongoing research programmes, including:
* The [Roosevelt Island Climate Evolution project (RICE)](http://www.rice.aq/).
* [Antarctic Sea Ice Switch (ASIS)](https://www.seaice.aq/), an NZ MBIE Endeavour programme focused on understanding recent dramatic shifts in sea ice within the Ross Sea.
* Diverse contributions to New Zealand's [Antarctic Science Platform](https://www.antarcticscienceplatform.org.nz/).
* Ongoing analysis of interactions between the Antarctic Ice Sheet and the Southern Ocean, funded through the [Strategic Science Investment Fund (SSIF)](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/science-and-technology/science-and-innovation/funding-information-and-opportunities/investment-funds/strategic-science-investment-fund).
