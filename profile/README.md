The NICRF is jointly funded by [Earth Sciences New Zealand](https://www.earthsciences.nz/) (formerly GNS Science) and [Victoria University of Wellington](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/).

We are engaged in a range of ongoing research programmes, including:
* The [Roosevelt Island Climate Evolution project (RICE)](http://www.rice.aq/).
* [Antarctic Sea Ice Switch (ASIS)](https://www.seaice.aq/), an NZ MBIE Endeavour programme focused on understanding recent dramatic shifts in sea ice within the Ross Sea.
* Diverse contributions to New Zealand's [Antarctic Science Platform](https://www.antarcticscienceplatform.org.nz/).
